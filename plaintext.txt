Once upon a time, in a misty valley surrounded by jagged mountains, a girl named Lila donned her crimson cloak and set off to visit her grandmother. Her basket brimmed with warm honeycakes, and her heart sang as she ventured into the ancient forest.

Lila’s grandmother lived in a secluded cave on the far side of the valley. She was a dragon tamer, the only one who dared live near the mighty dragons that nested in the cliffs. As Lila skipped along the trail, she didn’t notice a pair of golden eyes watching her from the shadows.

A cunning dragon named Searfang, with scales that shimmered like molten gold, emerged from the trees. “Where are you going, little one?” he purred, his voice a deep rumble.

“To see my grandmother,” Lila replied boldly. “She lives by the cliffs.”

Searfang grinned, revealing rows of sharp teeth. “How kind of you. Let me fly ahead and tell her you’re coming.” With a sweep of his wings, he vanished into the sky.

When Lila arrived, the cave was quiet. “Grandmother?” she called. A rasping voice answered, “Come closer, child.”

But Lila wasn’t fooled. She saw the flicker of fire in the shadows. “Why do you smell of smoke, Grandmother?” she asked.

Searfang lunged from the darkness, but Lila was prepared. She tossed a honeycake dusted with her grandmother’s secret spice—dragonbane powder. The moment Searfang bit into it, his fiery breath extinguished, and he fled, roaring in defeat.

Her real grandmother appeared, clapping her hands. “Clever girl!” she said. Together, they celebrated with honeycakes and stories of bravery.

From that day on, the dragons stayed clear of the crimson-cloaked girl who bested the mighty Searfang.
