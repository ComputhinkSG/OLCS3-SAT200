# Assignment
# Scenario: Identifying Star Students for an Award Ceremony
    
# Your school is preparing for the end-of-year award ceremony.
# The principal wants to recognise "Star Students" â€” those who have shown:
# - Excellent attendance (at least 90%)
# - Strong academic performance (score of at least 85)

# You're given two separate dictionaries:
# - One with student attendance (in %)
# - One with student scores (out of 100)

# Extract the names of students who meet both criteria.
# (1) Store them in a list called star_students.
    
# (2) Loop through the star_students list and 
#      print a congratulatory message to each star student like this:
# "Congratulations Chloe Lim! With an attendance of 95% and a score of 92,
# you are awarded the Star Student Award!""

# You may assume that the same keys exist in both dictionaries.
