# Scenario 1: Palindrome Checker

# Task
# (1) Ask the user to input a word.
# (2) Your code should work regardless of capitalisation.
    # e.g. Level, LEVEL, level are palindromes
# (3) Check if it is a palindrome.

# Expected output:
# The word [level] is a palindrome

# write your code here

# Given a word
word = "a b c d e f"
# print(word)

# Reverse the word
# if word.lower() == word[::-1].lower():
#     print(f"{word} is a palindrome")
# else:
#     print(f"{word} is not a palindrome")

#### 
# newword = ""
# for letter in word:
#     newword = letter + newword

# print(newword)


# alternative method to reverse (if cannot use slicing)

# PALINDROME

# Scenario 2: Palindrome Word Challenge (with Word List)

# A language teacher is preparing a classroom game. 
# Students must find palindromic words from a given list. 
# You're writing a program to help the teacher check '
# 'which words are palindromes.

# Task
# (1) Use the list below.
# (2) Loop through all the words.
# (3) Print only the words that are palindromes.
# ** BONUS: write a function to check if a word is a palindrome.
