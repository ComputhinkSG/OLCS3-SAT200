# Task 4: List Reverser

# Ask the user to enter a list of 5 numbers (one by one)
# Stores them in a list
# Reverses the list manually (without using reverse() or slice)
# Prints the reversed list

# reverse1 = numbers[::-1] # slicing (direct way to reverse)
# print(reverse1)

# reverse2 = numbers.reverse()
# print(numbers)

    reverse_list.insert(0, num)

# What is my Chinese Zodiac sign?
# In not more than 10 lines of code, write a program 
# to calculate the Chinese Zodiac sign based on a 
# user's year of birth. (hint: it can be done in 5 lines)

# The most common method depends on Chinese New Year, 
# which is considered as the division of two animal years. 
# When a lunar year comes to an end, the animal will shift to next one. 
# Chinese peopleâ€™s animal signs are marked by this method.

# How to Calculate Your Chinese zodiac sign mathematically?
# Divide your year of birth by 12 and get the remainder. 
# Each remainder corresponds to an animal sign below.

# 0: Monkey 1: Rooster 2: Dog 3: Pig 4: Rat 5: Ox 6: Tiger 
# 7: Rabbit 8: Dragon 9: Snake 10: Horse 11: Goat

# Sample Output
# Enter your birth year: 1977
# Your Chinese zodiac sign is: Snake
